    "Sher Singh breathed one more prayer, of thanks this time, and scrambled down into the river-bed. He stepped into the rive usual, and deeper than it had been. Sher Singh had to go slowly made ready to move with Kunwar on his back once again. HAn Sher Singh had been to this river often. But it was colder than because of slime on the stones. Thank goodness there was a bridge at the second river, he thought. It was a flimsy thing made of bamboo poles, stones, thick grass and river gravel. But it was at least a bridge. As Sher Singh washed up on to the shore, water twinkled in his footprints before sinking into the sand. Coming up out of the river were another set of prints-a tigers and there was glitter in them too. Even as he looked, they dried. He plodded steadily on, and his body panted and sobbed. Towards midnight he heard the second river ahead of him. He heard it from far away, a steady roar of flood. When he came out on the shore, he saw it. A big head of snow must have melted yesterday and here it was. From bank to bank, the river foamed. He looked for the bridge. It was not there. Only a fierce crest of water showed where it lay, submerged. Branches caught against the bridge feathered the wild glissade of water. Underneath, boulders moved. He could hear the river grinding its teeth. Then a tree, churning over and over, crashed against the drowned bridge, which heeled and broke, throwing up its bamboo ribs like a fan. So, now, how to cross? There was not a chance to swim. Even alone, he would be lost. Perhaps among the wreckage of the bridge, there was a way? Sher Singh set Kunwar down and brought him water from the river in his hands. My brother-the little boy whispered, and drank. Sher Singh gathered grass and plaited it into a rope. He tied the rope round his brother and himself so they would keep together. Then he entered the water just above the bridge. The river seize them and flattened them against the wreck. He could not move a first, then he edged forward into the maelstrom, feeling for the spiuends of bamboo. The deluge deafened him, timber banged and bruised him. as scold he could hardly keep his hold.",
    "Switzerland is the most peaceful country in the world. Although always prepared to face any hazard of war, it has never faced any hostile army since the Swiss Confederation was founded in 1815, nor has its army ever fired at anyone in aggression. Switzerland is, therefore, totally free of the ravages of war. No other European country can claim this distinction. Most of Switzerland's 16,000 square mile area is a continuous, rolling lush countryside of pastures, Vineyards and grain farms, except one third of the mountainous and extremely beautiful region. Three quarters of the population lives in small towns and villages which remain exquisitely medieval in their architecture and external appearance. At very short notice, it can convert itself into an army bristling with military defence, i.e. a whole nation in arms. People of Switzer- land can boast that they do not have an army, but they themselves are an army. The unique aspect of the military preparedness of Switzerland is its constant readiness for facing a nuclear attack or the consequences of a nuclear war in its neighbourhood. Dr. Morgellier, the Chief military spokesman told sometime back that .80% of the population of Switzerland can be moved into under-ground shelters within a few hours. Every aspect of the life of the citizens is tightly supervised by the local police. As a consequence, there is 100% compliance with three specific instructions: one is that every household must keep a reserve stock of approximately two months requirements of food and daily provisions. Secondly, the entire male population must take part in civil defence exercises and must be constantly available for military duty. Thirdly, everyone must be ready at all times with one's arms. The government issue arms and ammunition to each household. All men between 20 and 50 years of age must do military service and until the age of 32, must attend military colleges for 20 days every year and one at least for 90 days. The result is that although Switzerland's regular or standing army is only 65,000 strong, it can put 10 per cent of the population or 650,000 men in the field within 48 hours and all the rest in a few days more. Thus, Switzerland's concern with defence is such that outside observers describe it as an obsession. Words.",
    "The sun has a family of other planets which keep circling about it at different distances. The earth on which we live is one of those planets. There are nine planets and their names in the order of their distance from the sun are: Mercury (the nearest), Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. In addition to these, about 2,000 minor planets, some of them only a few miles in diameter, swarm round the Sun, between Mars and Jupiter. Mereury, the nearest, is about 30 million miles from the sun, less than half the distance of the earth. Naturally, it is much hotter than the earth. It is, therefore, too hot for anybody to live there. Mercury always turns the same face to the sun and its sunny side is about as hot as molten tin. Its cold side is just frozen masses like snow. Mercury is a small planet, only about one-twentieth, the size of the earth. Venus is 67,000,000 miles from the sun and is also distinctly hotter than the earth. It is certainly too hot to support life. Next after Venus, is the earth which revolves about the sun at a distance of 93,000,000 miles. Moon revolves round the earth at a distance of 2,40,000 miles. Moon is a dead world of dry rock and dust and it contains neither air nor water. It is about 1/50 as big and 1/100 as heavy as the earth. It revolves once every 27 days and so we get a new moon about once a month. The moon always keeps the same side facing the earth. The moon, like the planets, is a cold body which is only visible when the sun shines on it and that is why it appears to be in different shapes at different times. When the sun is shining on its farther side, we cannot see it at all and we say there is no moon. When the sunlight creeps gradually round its edge to show first a crescent, then gradually a bigger size. Full moon happens when the sun shines directly on the side of the moon taking the earth.",
    "Time is gold and time is money, if we utilize it in a prop way and would not tolerate to waste even a single minute, because lost minutes add up to lost hours, lost hours add up to lost days, 1Ost days add up to lost years and lost years add up to fruitless life or a life in which so much remained undone. Many of us that are to say office clerks, administrators, doctors, teachers, engineers, law- yers, journalists and others are content to drift along, through the day, because they do not prepare a definite schedule of their activities. So, at the end of every day, they find that very little has been achieved. This is how day succeeds day resulting in a life of very little achievement. Likewise, many of us have no fixed time for rising and so often we sleep extra-long and have to race through the morning news- paper, bath, dress, bolt our breakfast and hurry along to the office. Why is this so? Because we have no clear-cut idea of all that we have to do during the day. We chat overlong with a friend who may call and sometimes there are many callers resulting in half com-plated work which is differed to the next day. On the other hand, if we discipline ourselves rigidly and prep area schedule in advance of all our activities for the whole day and ration time in proportion to the importance of different spheres of activity, we can do much more in brief span of 24 hours and thus enjoy a sense of satisfaction and achievement. It is good to draw up a schedule for the next day's activity at night. By doing so, we know when exactly we have to rise next morning and at what pace we have to complete the various items on our schedule. We should set aside a certain amount of time every day for the family, exercise and recreation and for reading and other means of self-improvement. Often there are instructive and interesting talks by experts at some institution, exhibitions, music recitals and other cultural activities which we must not ignore, because these improve our personality. Thus, the secret of success in our life lies in the most scientific and systematic use of time, as far as possible.",
    "It is one thing to get into a community college. It is another to get credits for courses. Many students are ill-prepared. They may not be ready for college-level work. They must take remedial courses. Most remedial courses are for reading or math. The problem is that remedial courses cost money and take time. Students often feel like they are treading water. Some feel the remedial courses are not real college classes. The dropout rates are high. University of New York (CUNY) wanted to do something to reduce the dropout rate. The school looked at the results of the entry test. Some of the students had been out of school for several years. It focused on those students who almost passed. CUNY is letting those students who almost passed retake the test. About half pass on the second try. Was the test doing a good job of finding students who needed more help? CUNY decided that the answer was no. It put a new test in place. The steps for moving from remedial to credit classes is also changing. Before, students had to pass a test at the end of the remedial course. Now, they just must pass the course. They still take the test, but it is a factor for only 35 percent of the final grade. It may also start looking at how students did in certain high school classes. Algebra was a required part of the math entry exam. Now students can take an alternative course such as statistics. CUNY has taken one more step to make life better for students. While students are taking a remedial math course, they can take another course. This course will be a credit course. They call it a co-requisite course. The remedial course will help them pass the regular course. Community colleges in Tennessee have had good results with this approach. Everyone knows tests are important. But experts say tests should not be the only thing that matters. It makes good sense to move student ahead.",
    "The last thing you should do for back pain is use pain killers. Those are the opioids that can lead to addiction. And sometimes, they can lead to other drugs such as heroin. A new report takes a different approach. The report breaks down back pain into two groups. The first group includes pain that lasts less than twelve weeks. For this type of pain, the report says try applying heat or getting a massage. Exercise can help. You can try acupuncture. You can go to a chiropractor. You can try over-the-counter drugs such as Advil. The report says some common drugs like Tylenol are not effective. See what works best for you. You can get drugs such as Celebrex or Flexeril from your doctor. There are drugs that are more powerful. Cymbalta treats anxiety and depression. Tramadol is a less addicting opioid. Discuss any use with your doctor. The second pain group includes chronic pain that lasts more than twelve weeks. You should try the methods listed above first. If they do not work, there are other things to do. You can try physical therapy. You can try stress reduction. The report says you might want to try mindfulness or behavioral therapy. Talk to a professional about what might work best for you. Most adults have back pain at some time in their life. It is often the reason people miss work. It happens as people get older and their bodies change. It involves changes in the spine, muscles, discs and nerves. It involves the way people move. It can be the result of poor posture. Back pain can happen without warning. It can be the result of an accident or by lifting something heavy. It can be the result of too much or too little exercise. A doctor said. About one-quarter of U.S. adults have had back pain in the past few months. The doctor said that it is a good idea to try not to use drugs. He said opioids, even for chronic back pain, are prescribed more often than we like to see. Recent studies have found that doctors have their preferences. You may have to ask around for a health professional who favors more natural approaches. There is no one-size-fits-all answer.",
    "The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to free speech. It guarantees not just the right to make free speech, but the right to hear free speech. The internet is one path to free speech in America. In America, there are debates over the cost of internet services. In China, the government is shutting down internet debate, period. The way the Chinese do this is by closing down internet networks. Censors do not allow Chinese access to YouTube and Google among others. The Chinese practice of closing down the internet is not new. In recent weeks it has become worse. Some say the current climate is the result of the lead-up to a key Chinese Communist Party meeting. The 19th Party Congress takes place this fall. For a long time, smart Chinese internet users have gotten around the censors. Most of them use virtual private networks (VPNs). These are ways of getting around the bans on content. The authorities are targeting these tools. For example, they made Apple pull its VPN apps off the shelves in its stores. Amazon has a cloud computing service. It warned its customers to stop hosting the VPN tools on their sites. Some observers call this a 'cat and mouse game.' Last week the censors showed how much power they had. The censors tried a new way of shutting down websites. They went after the tools that many Chinese use. They cut off the country's internet users from the rest of the world. Internet users continue to try to outwit the country's vast online censorship system. For example, some users can still get to foreign VPNs. An expert said, It does appear the crackdown is becoming more intense. But the internet is also more powerful than it has ever been. Some say China is trying to create a great firewall. Can a country that stifles free speech be a great nation?",
    "Dreamers came to the U.S. as children with their parents. The parents were here without legal documents. President Obama said the Dreamers could stay and go to school and work. President Trump has now said they cannot. There are about 800,000 Dreamers in the U.S. People who support and people who oppose Dreamers agree on one thing. The U.S. Congress is the right place to decide their fate. The Dreamers are here in the Latin phrase as de facto residents. In fact, they are here. They are not here as de jure residents. They are not legal residents protected by law. What happens next? How do you make Congress act? Some think a new civil rights movement will start. Dreamers have many supporters in every sector of the nation. They will have to work together and begin campaigns to make Congress work on their behalf. Opponents of the Dreamers will also make a big effort. They oppose Dreamers for two reasons. The first reason is that they think President Obama did not have the legal right to allow the Dreamers to stay in the country. The second reason is that they are against what they call illegal immigration. They believe that, if Congress acts, it should deport the Dreamers. And all who came or stayed in the U.S. without papers. History should be on the side of the Dreamers. All over the world, people are on the move to improve their lives. Some are fleeing war. Others are fleeing poverty. In general, the burden is on the country taking them in to do the right thing. The migrants are leaving failed states. That includes Mexico. But the difference is that states are states and people are people. You cannot treat them in the same way. The Dreamers came to America as children. They were not a party to the decision to go to the U.S. That is a strong moral argument on their behalf. For opponents, it does not matter. Opponents believe Dreamers are taking jobs and seats in schools away from 'Americans.' At the same time, friends and many foes think the Dreamers are good people. Trump has expressed support for Dreamers. During the campaign, Trump said he would and now has, ended the Dreamers' program. In the days ahead, details of how the program will end will come out. In the months ahead, Americans will have their views tested in the political arenas of the nation.",
    "Before he launched the most viral video in Internet history, Jason Russell was a half-hearted Web presence. His YouTube account was dead, and his Facebook and Twitter pages were a trickle of kid pictures and home-garden updates. The Web wasn't made to keep track of how much people like us, he thought, and when his own tech habits made him feel like a genius, an addict, or a megalomaniac, he unplugged for days, believing, as the humorist Andy Borowitz put it in a tweet that Russell tagged as a favorite, it's important to turn off our computers and do things in the real world. But this past March Russell struggled to turn off anything. He forwarded a link to Kony 2012, his deeply personal Web documentary about the African warlord Joseph Kony. The idea was to use social media to make Kony famous as the first step to stopping his crimes. And it seemed to work: the film hurtled through cyberspace, clocking more than 70 million views in less than a week. But something happened to Russell in the process. The same digital tools that supported his mission seemed to tear at his psyche, exposing him to nonstop kudos and criticisms, and ending his arm's-length relationship with new media. He slept two hours in the first four days, producing a swirl of bizarre Twitter updates. He sent a link to I Met the Walrus, a short animated interview with John Lennon, urging followers to start training your mind. He sent a picture of his tattoo, TIMSHEL, a biblical word about man's choice between good and evil. At one point he uploaded and commented on a digital photo of a text message from his mother. At another he compared his life to the mind-bending movie Inception, a dream inside a dream. On the eighth day of his strange, 21st-century vortex, he sent a final tweet-a quote from Martin Luther King Jr.: If you can't fly, then run, if you can't run, then walk, if you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward -and walked back into the real world. He took off his clothes and went to the corner of a busy intersection near his home in San Diego, where he repeatedly slapped the concrete with both palms and ranted about the devil. This too became a viral video.",
    "I am not usually comfortable in a bar by myself, but I had been in San Francisco for a week and the apartment I sublet had no chairs in it, just a bed and a couch. My friends in town were married or worked nights. One Tuesday I had lentil soup for supper standing up at the kitchen counter. After I finished, I moved to the couch in the empty living room and sat under the flat overhead light refreshing feeds on my laptop. This was not a way to live. A man would go to a bar alone, I told myself. So I went to a bar alone. I sat on a stool at the centre of the bar, ordered a beer, and refreshed the feeds on my mobile. I waited for something to happen. A basketball game played on several monitors at once. The bar had red fake leather booths, Christmas lights and a female bartender. A lesbian couple cuddled at one end of it. At the other end, around the corner from where I sat, a bespectacled man my age watched the game. As the only man and the only woman alone at the bar, we looked at each other. Then I pretended to watch the game on a monitor that allowed me to look the other way. He turned his back to me to watch the monitor over the pool tables, where the pool players now applauded some exploit. I waited to be approached. A few stools down, two men broke into laughter. One came over to show me why they were laughing. He handed me his mobile and pointed to a Facebook post. I read the post and smiled obligingly. The man returned to his seat. I drank my beer. I allowed myself a moment's longing for my living room and its couch. The couch had a woollen blanket woven in a Navajo-inspired pattern, exemplary of a trend in San Francisco that a friend of mine calls 'White People Gone Wild'. When I moved in, the receipt for the blanket was on the mantelpiece. It had cost $228. There was a cast-iron gas stove in the fireplace. I had fiddled with the knobs and the gas, but couldn't figure out how to ignite it. At night the room had the temperature and pallor of a corpse. There was no television.",
    "A British publishing house issued, some years ago, a volume of sermons, under the title, If I could Preach Only Once. One of these sermons was by Gilbert Chesterton If I had only one sermon to preach. Chesterton declared, it would be sermon against fear. Why should this eminent man of letters single out so ordinary an adversary? First of all, because fear is one of man's most common enemies. It touches every one of us in some way. Many people, for example, have financial fears. We have fears of ill health, anticipating the direful consequences of being overtaken by some bodily affliction. We allow ourselves to be made miserable by fear of what the future holds of fears of the consequences of past acts and decisions. Fears of one kind and another haunt us and cast a shadow over our happiness. No person is at his best or in full control of his powers if he is the victim of fear. In many ways fear lays its paralyzing hand upon an individual and becomes a chief obstacle to the full development of personality and to the achievement of success in life. The person who wishes to become adept in the art of living must learn to conquer and subdue his fears. This is a problem common to us all, and I want to state at the outset the encouraging fact that any every individual can your fears. Others may help you but ultimately you must do it yourself. The first step and, for that matter, a large part of the campaign against one's fears is to get a complete and thorough-going knowledge of them. Bring them out into the light of day and watch them shrivel up. A fear is not unlike a ghost. It frightens you in the gloom, but there isn't much to it when you get it into the light. Most of the things one fears never happen; at least the do no amount when anything. As one frog in a pond may sound like a hundred when one is trying to sleep, so one little fact may be enlarged by mental fear and distorted imaging out of all proportion to its real size. Once in a lonely cabin on a dark night, deep in the North Woods, I heard on the porch noises that sent a shiver up my spine. It sounded like the cautions approach of several intruders. I sat transfixed, rooted to my chair, with every hair seemingly standing on end. Newspaper accounts of a recent murder in that section flashed across my mind.",
    "Phatik Chakravarti was the ring-leader amongst the boys of the village. One day a plan for new mischief entered his head. There was a heavy log lying on the mud-flat of the river, waiting to be shaped into a mast for a boat. His plan was that they should all work together to shift the log by main force from its place and roll it away. The owner of the log would be angry and surprised, while they would all enjoy the fun. Every one supported the proposal, and it was carried unanimously. Bu just as the fun was about they should all work together to shift the log by main force from the place and roll it away. The owner of the log would be angry and surprised, while they would all enjoy the fun. Every one supported the proposal, and it was carried unanimously. But just as the fun was about to begin, Makhan, Phatik's younger brother, sauntered up without a word and sat down on the log in front of them all. The boys were puzzled for a moment. One of them pushed him rather timidly and told him to get up; but he remained quite unconcerned. He appeared like a young philosopher meditating on the futility of thing. Phatik was furious. Philosopher meditating on the futility of things. Phatik was furious. 'Makhan', he cried, 'if you don't get up this minute. I'll thrash you!' Makhan only moved to a more comfortable position, it was if Phatik was to keep his regal dignity before the public, it was clear that he must carry out his threat. But his courage failed him at the crisis. His fertile brain, however, rapidly seized upon a new manoeuvre which would discomfit his brother and afford his followers added amusement. He gave the word and command to roll the log and Makhan over together. Makhan heard the order and made it a point of honour to stick on. But like those who attempt earthly fame in other matters, he overlooked the fact that there was peril in it. The boys began to heave at the log with all their might calling out, One, two, three, go! At the word 'go' the log went; and with it went Makhan's philosophy, glory and tall. The other boys shouted themselves hoarse with delight. But Phatik was little frightened. He knew what was coming, and he was not mistaken, for Makhan rose from Mother Earth blind as Fate and screaming like the Furies. He rushed at Phatik, scratched his face, beat him and kicked him, and them went crying home. The first act of the drama was over.",
    "When the man first began to think, he asked himself the deepest of all questions a question which you have undoubtedly asked yourself many times: What is the meaning of Life? What is it all about? Where are we all going? What drives men ever forward to work and worry? And now there's this other big question-a newer question which is beginning to force itself into our notice. One that is not ages old. That has not been with us since man first began to think. It is: Where is Science Taking Us? First, where is science taking us with regard to ethical and spiritual values? We know what it is doing with regard to material things, for material things are its daily business; but what is it doing with regard to non-material things? If the answer were 'nothing at all,' that would be bad enough; but the actual answer is 'less than nothing.' Here science is actually doing less than nothing. Its material teaching has been so over-emphasized that many people are floundering and wondering whether after all man is but a machine animated by forces over which he has no control. Let's concentrate on material things, the things that form the very stronghold of science. Look at the machine, for instance. This is the age of the machine. Machine are everywhere-in the fields, in the factory, in the home, in the street, in the city, in the country, everywhere. To fly, it is not necessary to have wings; there are machines. To swim under the sea, it is not necessary to have gills, there are machines. To kill our fellow men in overwhelming numbers, there are machines. Petrol machines alone provide ten times more power than all human beings in the world. In the busiest countries, each individual has six hundred human slaves in his machines. What are the consequences of this abnormal power? Before the war, it looked as though it might be possible, for the first time in history, to provide food and clothing and shelter fort the teeming population of the world-every man, woman and child. This would have been one of the greatest triumphs of science. And yet, many a time especially during the war we have seen the world crammed full of food and people hungry. For that's the way of science and the machine age. Science produces the goods, it makes the goods, but has no control over the consequences.",
    "The machine age gives us year by year more hours of leisure but it fails to teach us how to use them. It gives us mechanical habits of mind and represses the spirit to adventure-except along machine-made lines. We will need all our creative powers to think our way our of the social problems which science has created for us. It is science that has given us the unexpected redistribution of the age groups. Almost every year, some modem drug adds a little more to the average span of life, until the upper group is overcrowded. In the United States, for instance, there are already nine million people 1950's. In fifteen years' time, this number will reach the astonishing figure of forty-five million. Who is to keep them? It will need some readjustment. And so, science goes on raising its problems. Compared with our fundamental question-What is Life? These problems may seem to be of less importance. But they are not really so. What is happening is that science is creating problems faster than they can be solved. Man is struggling in a sort of vicious circle, always striving to catch up and never getting nearer. And there are no signs that the glut of discoveries is coming to an end. War is the most example; Science has pushed it so far forward that ethics and morals are floundering hopelessly behind. It makes one sometimes ask: What is science really after? What are its aims? What is its goal? Its aims seem to be obvious. They are material, of course. One aim is the complete understanding, indeed the conquest, of man's environment; the conquest of everything material, big or small, bringing all powers within man's reach. The order aim is the understanding of all the mysteries that lie within the human body-the material mysteries, the innumerable chemical and physical actions that make the body work. If these are the apparent aims of science, surely, they cannot represent the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal, if there is such a thing, must be the understanding of everything that makes life worthwhile, the enrichment of all that if life means. That goes beyond material things; for man needs more than food and shelter and clothing and the understanding of what goes on within his stomach.",
    "The greatest day in any individual's life is when he begins for the first time to realize himself. If happened to a college student friend of mine once with dramatic suddenness. He was as unsuccessful in his studies as he was efficient upon the athletic field. It happened to a college student friend of mine once with dramatic suddenness. He was as unsuccessful in his studies as he was efficient upon the athletic field. Destiny, however, has it own strange ways. One day in a class in Psychology, our student friend suddenly become enthralled as the professor described how the average man fails because he does not learn to control and consolidate his powers. He used the familiar illustration of the burning glass. The rays of the sun, failing upon a piece of paper, have little effect. Let them, however, be drawn by the burning glass to a focus and they create an intense heat which will quickly burn a hole in the paper. The professor pointed out that the man who succeeds is the one who can draw his dissipated and therefore futile powers to a focus. Our student said that in a flashing illumination he saw the cause of this own failure and oblivious of all in the room and under the spell of a veritable new birth leaped to his feet, crying, I see it; I see it What had happened? He had met himself, a new self, his real self, which he never before had had seen and the revelation changed him form from a failure to a potential success, the possibilities of which were later abundantly realized. He was now a grand success in whatever he chose to do. In this famous address on The Energies of Men William James, a great psychologist, said, Men habitually use only a small part of the powers which they possess and which they might use under appropriate circumstances. A scientist is reported recently to have said that the average man uses but twenty per cent of his brain power. When you think o some people, that sounds like optimism. Think of it-you are using, if you are an average person, only one fifth of your mental capacity. Consider what you could make of life if you increased that by only fifty per cent. In the personality of every individual there is a greatest reservoir of unused power. But in many of us just a miserable little trickle is getting through, and on that we live and do our work.",
    "When my parents were comfortably settled in the city, they sent for us. That was a turning-point in our friendship. Although we shared the same room, my grandmother no longer came to school with me. I used to go to an English school in a motor bus. There were no dogs in the streets and she took to feeding sparrows in the courtyard of our city house. As years rolled by, we saw less of each other. For some time, she continued to wake me up and get me ready for school. When I came back she would ask me what the teacher had taught me. I would tell her English words and little things of western science and learning the law of gravity, Archimedes' principle, the world being round, etc. This made her unhappy, she could not help me with my lessons. She did not believe in the things they taught at the English school and was distressed that there was no teaching bout God and the scriptures. One day I announced that we were being given music lessons. She was very disturbed. To her music has lewd associations. It was the monopoly of harlots and beggars and not meant for gentlefolk. She said nothing but her silence meant disapproved. She rarely talked to me after that. When I went up to the University, I was given a room of my own. The common link of friendship was snapped. My grandmother accepted her seclusion with resignation. She rarely left her spinning-wheel to talk to anyone. From sunset she sat by her wheel to feed the sparrows. While she sat in the verandah breaking the bread into little bits, hundreds of little birds collected round her creating a veritable bedlam of chirruping. Some came and perched on her legs, others on her shoulders. Some even sat on her head. She smiled but never shoo'd them away. It used to be the happiest half-hour of the day for her. When I decided to go abroad for further studies, I was sure my grandmother would be upset. I would be away for five years, and at her age one could never tell. But my grandmother could she was not even sentimental. She came to leave me at the railway station but did not talk or show any emotion. Her lips moved in prayers, her mind was lost in prayer. Her fingers were busy telling the beads of her rosary. Silently she kissed my forehead, and when I left I cherished the mist imprint as perhaps the last sign of physical contact between us. But that was not so. After five years I came back home and was met by her at the station.",
    "Agatha Christie was one of England's most famous writers. Her crime and detective stores became famous for their clever plots. Agatha Christie was often called the queen of crime. Agatha Christie was born in Devon, England in 1890 as the daughter of a British army captain. During the First World War she worked in a hospital as a nurse. Later on she got a job in a pharmacy. This influenced many of her crime stories because some of her victims were poisoned. Agatha Christie was married twice and especially her second husband travelled a lot with her. Some of her novels, like Death on the Nile were set in the Middle East. Murder on the Orient Express was written in Istanbul. At the beginning of the 1970s Agatha Christie became ill, but she went on writing. When she died in 1976 she had written over 60 novels, 150 short stories and 16 plays. Her stage play The Mousetrap is the longest running play in history. It was first performed in 1952 and after a record 23,000 performances it is still running today. Many of Christie's books and short stories have been turned into successful movies. In her works Agatha Christie created two great characters. Hercule Poirot is a Belgian detective who appeared in 33 of Agatha Christie's novels. He his best known for his moustache. Poirot thinks logically and likes order. He examines the crime scene in detail and claims that every crime can be solved. As time went on Agatha Christie became tired of her Belgian detective and wanted to get rid of him. But he was very popular among her readers. When he died in Curtain in 1978 he became the only fictional character to get an obituary in the New York Times. Agatha Christie's other well-known character was Miss Marple, an old woman who wants to be an amateur detective. She likes knitting, walking around the neighborhood and she observes things very carefully. She became famous for solving cases where the police failed. In contrast to Hercule Poirot, Christie was very fond of Miss Marple. Almost all of Agatha Christie's novels are whodunits. They focus on English people of the middle and upper classes. Usually the detective comes across a murder scene by chance or is called by a friend who may be involved. He or she questions the suspects, examines the crime scene carefully and gives the reader clues so that they may have a chance to solve the crime themselves.",
    "Between 1910 and 1970 the Australian government took 100,000 Aboriginal children away from their homes. These children, known as the Stolen Generation, were often under five years of age. They were taken away from their families because the government did not believe in the future of the Aborigines. They thought it would be better to bring them to white families. Many methods were used to separate Aboriginal babies and children from their families. Children were simply taken away by government officials and later told that they were orphans. Mothers often were given documents to sign. They could not read or write and they were told it was some kind of vaccination program. Others were taken to hospitals and never seen by their families again. In most cases rich white families were given money to bring them up. Some went to orphanages or church missions. In 1995 an investigation was stated to bring more truth to the topic. The government however did not apologize to the victims. The new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was the first Australian politician to make a formal apology to the Aborigines in 2008. However, he also said that the government would not give any money to the victims. He claimed that it was in the interests of government to raise the children in the best way. Up to now only one member of Australia's Stolen Generation has received money from the government. Bruce Trevor-row was taken to hospital on Christmas Day in 1957. His father never saw him again and the government sent him to a white foster family. He came back to his mother when he was ten years old. In his further life he suffered from depression and turned to alcohol. In 1998 he went to court and succeeded in getting about 500,000 dollars from the Australian government as a form of compensation. There are many others in Australia who have suffered the same fate. Organizations are being set up to work for the rights of the Aborigines and to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again.",
    "That was a jolly story which Mr.Arthur Ransome told the other day in one of his messages from pertrograd. A stout old lady was walking with her basket down the middle of a street in Petrograd to the great confusion of the traffic and with no small peril to herself. It was pointed out to her that the pavement was the place for foot passengers, but she replied: 'I' m going to walk where I like. We've got liberty now.' It did not occur to the dead old lady that if liberty entitled the foot passenger to walk down the middle of a road, it also entitled the car driver to drive on the pavement, and that the end of such liberty would be universal chaos. Everybody would be getting in everybody else's way and nobody would get anywhere. Individual liberty would be getting in everybody else's way and nobody would get anywhere. Individual liberty would have become social anarchy. There is a danger of the world getting liberty-drunk in these days like the old lady with the basket, and it is just as well to remind ourselves of what the rule of the road means. It means that in order that the liberties of all may be preserved, the liveries of everybody must be curtailed. When the policeman, say at Picadilly Circus, steps into the middle of the road and puts out his hand, he is the symbol not of tyranny, but of liberty. You may not think so, you may, being in a hurry and seeing your motor car pulled up by this insolence of office, feel that your liberty has been outraged. How dare this fellow interfere with your free use of the public highway? Then, if you are a reasonable person, you will reflect that if he did not, incidentally, interfere with you he would interfere with no one, and the result would be that Piccadilly Circus would be a maelstrom that you would never cross at all. You have submitted to a curtailment of private liberty in order that you may enjoy a social order which makes your liberty a reality.",
    "Music can be the most important and powerful things of anyone life who loves to listen or play music and know its importance in their life. One who listen or play music never get fed up of any problems in the life. It helps in distressing and relaxing the mind as well as motivates to do something better in the life. Many people love to listen and play music at many occasions or events. Some of the people become used to of listening music in their all time such as in the office, home on the way, etc. It keeps away from all the problems of life and gives solutions. Now-a-days, there is a trend of playing slow music in the offices of big companies while employees are working in order to keep mind fresh, peaceful, concentrate, bring positive thoughts as well as increasing the performance of the employees. I got my music loving habit in the generation from parents and grandparents because my father and grandfather were very fond of listening music. Slow music always run in my home from morning till night. I don't know much about the musical compositions but I generally like to listen music whenever I travel or during my study time. On the weekend, we dance, listen music or play music with family at home or at picnic on any favorite place. Music touches my soul and spirit and makes me realize that I have no any problems in this world. Music is very powerful and has ability to convey positive messages to all sorts of emotion without telling and asking anything to anyone. It is voiceless however tells everything and shares all the problems more than the human being. Music has inspiring and promoting nature which increases the concentration power of the human being by removing all the negative thoughts. Music is the thing which helps us in re-memorizing our good memories of the past with our loved ones and dear ones. It has no limitations, drawbacks and guidelines; it only needs anyone to listen or play passionately with full devotion. When we listen music, it brings amazing feeling in the heart and mind which connects our spirit to the supernatural power of God. There is a very true saying about the music that music imitates life and life imitates music. Being inspired, I also started learning music and playing guitar and hope would be a good music player a day."
